This holds an experimental HTML5 interface for dmoz navigation and editing powered by many JavaScript libraries.

Currenlty non functional (work in progress).

Steps of this project:

	1 - Write semantically correct ODP documents ( ODP public pages on HTML5 ).
	2 - Write core functions to parse data and dinamically build such documents. ( near future will get the data from dmoz APIs )
	3 - Make use of drag and drop and many other functions provided by the HTML5 expecification and/or other power javascipt libraries for editing task
